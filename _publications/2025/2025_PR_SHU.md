  Holographic near-eye augmented reality (AR) displays featuring tilted inbound/outbound angles on compact optical combiners hold significant potential yet often struggle to deliver satisfying image quality. This is primarily attributed to two reasons: the lack of a robust off-axis-supported phase hologram generation algorithm; and the suboptimal performance of ill-tuned hardware parts such as imperfect holographic optical elements (HOEs). To address these issues, we incorporate a gradient descent-based phase retrieval algorithm with spectrum remapping, allowing for precise hologram generation with wave propagation between nonparallel planes. Further, we apply a camera-calibrated propagation scheme to iteratively optimize holograms, mitigating imperfections arising from the defects in the HOE fabrication process and other hardware parts, thereby significantly lifting the holographic image quality. We build an off-axis holographic near-eye display prototype using off-the-shelf light engine parts and a customized full-color HOE, demonstrating state-of-the-art virtual reality and AR display results.
