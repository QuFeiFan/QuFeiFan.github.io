  Holography enhances VR and AR displays by providing realistic 3D imagery, but current computer‐generated hologram (CGH) algorithms face high computational demands. This work presents an efficient hologram generation and compression method using a pre‐trained wave propagation model and a filter‐free design. The approach reduces data redundancy, simplifies hardware, and achieves near real‐time decoding, enabling practical use in compact AR/VR systems.
